# Train_Activity

This project displays a train schedule for any number of trains added. Trains are added down below. 
The first train time will specify the train's first arrival on the current day it is listed. 
The green '=' button will allow the user to edit specific parts of that train. Editing the text under 'Next Arrival' will edit the trains specific first arrival time.
The user can leave any of the text boxes empty and it won't change their values.
Leaving all the text boxes emptied will not require a reset.
The red 'X' button will delete the train.
Be warned it will delete it without displaying a warning.
